## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 📊 Flight Price Prediction (Multiple Models)
Developed a predictive model to forecast airline ticket prices by Implementing and comparing multiple
algorithms including Linear Regression, XGBoost, and Random Forest to identify the most robust
performer.Also Optimized the final model using RandomizedSearchCV, significantly reducing Mean
Absolute Error (MAE)


### 🛒 Obesity Level Indicator
Developed a machine learning system using Decision Trees to classify obesity levels. I successfully deployed
this model using Render, demonstrating my ability to move beyond local environments to create accessible,
live applications.
